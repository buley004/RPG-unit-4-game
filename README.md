# RPG-unit-4-game

This is an RPG game where the user selects one member of The Beatles, and fights the remaining members.  The game ends when the user is defeated, or the user has defeated all remaining members.  Each fighter has three stats: health points, attack points, and counter attack points.

Whenever the player clicks `attack`, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture.

Each time the player attacks, their attack power is increased by their base attack power.  Counter attack power remains the same.  Once an enemy is defeated, the player can choose their next enemy, until all enemies have been defeated.  Once all enemies are defeated, or the player has dropped to zero HP, a message is displayed with the outcome of the game and the player has the option to restart the game.
